  <h1>Hi, my name is Eric Liu. <span>Here's a little bit about me.</span></h1>
  <div>
    Currently based in Boston, I previously worked as a support engineer and a business analyst before leaving these to take a course in architectural studio and pursue UX.<br>
    Although I’m just beginning to dip my toes in the world of design, I’m greatly interested in finding thoughtfully designed solutions for hard problems. Outside of design/work, I spent time with my Shiba Inu and enjoy reading, sketching, and skating.<br>
    At the moment, ethical consumer goods company, education platforms, and healthcare applications greatly appeal to me. However, I’m ultimately looking for a company values both the wellbeing of the customer and the continuous learning and growth of its employees.
