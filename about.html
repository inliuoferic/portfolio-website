    <div style="text-align: left;">
      Currently based in Boston, I previously worked as a support engineer and a business analyst before leaving these to take a course in architectural studio and pursue UX.<br>
      Although I’m just beginning to dip my toes in the world of design, I’m greatly interested in finding thoughtfully designed solutions for hard problems. Outside of design/work, I spent time with my Shiba Inu and enjoy reading, sketching, and
      skating.<br>
      At the moment, ethical consumer goods company, education platforms, and healthcare applications greatly appeal to me. However, I’m ultimately looking for a company values both the wellbeing of the customer and the continuous learning and
      growth of its employees.
